This GitHub repository contains code to create static personal website deploed in the cloud.

The aim of this website is to showcase my skills in all areas of the software development life cycle which include and are not limited to conceptualizing, website designing, planning for a minimal viable product, testing, release planning, releasing, and documenting and user-facing technical and non-technical documentation. I am using CircleCI to build and deploy my website using enterprise style deployment pattern by deploying feature branches.
